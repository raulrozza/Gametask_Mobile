# GameTask App

GameTask is an open-source gamification app, where users can create their own games, invite players and begin playing.

This app is currently being tested, and you can test it by downloading the **ExpoGo** app and scanning the QR Code [on this page](https://expo.io/@raulrozza/projects/gametask) with it.

The app is one component of the whole application. Feel free to also check the [GameTask API](https://github.com/raulrozza/Gametask_API) and the [GameTask Web](https://github.com/raulrozza/Gametask_Web)
